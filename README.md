# Mini Blockchain in Rust

A minimal blockchain implementation in Rust featuring:

- **Proof-of-Work mining**: Blocks are mined to meet a hash target.
- **Dynamic difficulty adjustment**: The difficulty changes based on block mining times.
- **Educational focus**: Simple, clear code to demonstrate blockchain principles.

## Features

- **Genesis Block**: The initial block of the chain.
- **Mining**: Includes a nonce and hash-based mining process.
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Dynamically adjusts mining difficulty to meet a target block time.
- **Validation**: Ensures the integrity of the chain by verifying hashes and block order.
